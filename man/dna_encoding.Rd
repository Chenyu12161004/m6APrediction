\title{Encode DNA Sequences into One-Hot Format}
\usage{
dna_encoding(dna_strings)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna_strings}{A character vector of DNA sequences. All strings must
have the same length.}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row corresponds to an input DNA string,
and columns represent the one-hot encoded nucleotides at each position.
}
\description{
This function converts a vector of DNA strings into a one-hot encoded
data frame. Each position in the DNA sequence becomes a set of columns
representing the nucleotide (A, T, C, G). This is an internal helper
function.
